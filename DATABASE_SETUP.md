# Vaultora Database Setup

This guide will help you set up the complete database for the Vaultora cybersecurity website.

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Using the Complete Setup File

1. **Go to your Supabase project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/00000000000000_complete_setup.sql`**
4. **Click "Run"**

This single file contains everything you need:
- âœ… All database tables and relationships
- âœ… Security policies (RLS)
- âœ… Initial data (pricing plans, services, testimonials, blog posts)
- âœ… Admin functions and triggers

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI (Advanced)

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Initialize Supabase (if not already done)
supabase init

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Run migrations
supabase db push
```

## After Database Setup

### 1. Create Your Admin Account

1. **Sign up** on your website at `/admin`
2. **Note your email address**

### 2. Make Yourself Admin

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
SELECT public.make_user_admin('your-email@example.com');
```

Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual email.

### 3. Verify Setup

You should now be able to:
- âœ… Access the admin dashboard at `/admin`
- âœ… Manage blog posts, pricing, testimonials
- âœ… View contact form submissions
- âœ… See the website with all content loaded
