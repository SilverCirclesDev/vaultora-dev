# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the SPA routing issue by configuring Vite's development server to properly handle client-side routes. The solution involves updating the Vite configuration to include historyApiFallback, which will serve the main `index.html` file for any route that doesn't match a static file, allowing React Router to handle the routing on the client side.

## Architecture

The fix involves three main components:

1. **Vite Configuration Update**: Add historyApiFallback to the server configuration
2. **Static Asset Handling**: Ensure static assets continue to be served correctly
3. **Error Cleanup**: Address console warnings and errors for better user experience

```
Browser Request → Vite Dev Server → Route Check → Static File OR index.html → React Router → Component
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Vite Server Configuration

The Vite configuration will be updated to include:

```typescript
server: {
  host: "::",
  port: 8080,
  historyApiFallback: true, // New addition
}
```

### Static Asset Handling

Static assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts) will continue to be served directly by Vite without going through the fallback mechanism. This is handled automatically by Vite's built-in logic.

### Route Resolution Flow

1. **Static Asset Request**: If the request is for a static asset (`.js`, `.css`, `.png`, etc.), serve the file directly
2. **API Route Request**: If the request matches an API pattern, pass through to the backend
3. **SPA Route Request**: For all other requests, serve `index.html` and let React Router handle routing

## Data Models

No new data models are required for this fix. The existing routing structure in React Router remains unchanged:

- Root routes: `/`, `/pricing`, `/blog`
- Admin routes: `/admin/*`
- Special routes: `/setup-database`
- Catch-all: `*` (NotFound component)

## Error Handling

### Console Warning Resolution

1. **React Router Future Flags**: Add future flags to eliminate deprecation warnings
2. **Missing Favicon**: Ensure proper favicon configuration in `index.html`
3. **License Error**: Investigate and resolve the tracking.js license error

### Fallback Behavior

- Valid routes → Serve index.html → React Router handles routing
- Invalid routes → Serve index.html → React Router shows NotFound component
- Static assets → Serve directly without fallback

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing

1. **Direct URL Access**: Test accessing `/admin/pricing` directly in browser
2. **Page Refresh**: Test refreshing pages at various routes
3. **Navigation Flow**: Test normal navigation still works
4. **Static Assets**: Verify CSS, JS, and images load correctly

### Verification Steps

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8082/admin/pricing` directly
3. Refresh the page and verify it loads correctly
4. Check browser console for reduced error messages
5. Test navigation between routes works normally

### Edge Cases

- Routes with query parameters: `/admin/pricing?tab=basic`
- Routes with hash fragments: `/admin/dashboard#settings`
- Non-existent routes: `/admin/nonexistent` should show NotFound

## Implementation Notes

### Vite Configuration Priority

The historyApiFallback option should be added to the existing server configuration without disrupting:
- Host and port settings
- Hot module replacement
- Development mode features

### Production Considerations

While this fix addresses the development server, production deployment will need similar configuration:
- Nginx: `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;`
- Apache: URL rewriting rules
- Static hosting services: Usually have SPA support built-in

### Backward Compatibility

This change is purely additive and won't break existing functionality:
- Existing routes continue to work
- Static asset serving remains unchanged
- API routes (if any) are unaffected
