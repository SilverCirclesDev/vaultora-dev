# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue where refreshing pages with client-side routes (like `/admin/pricing`) results in blank pages or errors. The application uses React Router for client-side navigation but lacks proper server-side configuration to handle direct URL access and page refreshes.

## Glossary

- **SPA**: Single Page Application - a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content
- **Client-side routing**: Navigation handled by JavaScript in the browser without server requests
- **Vite Dev Server**: The development server provided by Vite for serving the application during development
- **Fallback routing**: Server configuration that serves the main HTML file for unmatched routes
- **React Router**: The routing library used for client-side navigation in React applications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to refresh any page in the application and see the correct content, so that I can bookmark and share direct links to specific pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes the page at `/admin/pricing`, THE Vite Dev Server SHALL serve the main index.html file
2. WHEN a user directly navigates to `/admin/dashboard` via URL, THE Vite Dev Server SHALL serve the main index.html file
3. WHEN a user refreshes any admin route, THE React Router SHALL handle the routing and display the correct component
4. WHEN a user accesses a non-existent route, THE React Router SHALL display the NotFound component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to properly handle SPA routing, so that the application behaves consistently during development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vite Dev Server SHALL be configured with historyApiFallback to serve index.html for unmatched routes
2. THE Vite Dev Server SHALL continue to serve static assets (CSS, JS, images) normally
3. THE Vite Dev Server SHALL not interfere with API routes or other server endpoints
4. THE Vite Dev Server SHALL maintain hot module replacement functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without console errors when accessing routes directly, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any valid route directly, THE application SHALL load without routing-related console errors
2. THE React Router warnings SHALL be addressed to reduce console noise
3. THE application SHALL handle the license error gracefully without breaking functionality
4. THE missing favicon error SHALL be resolved to prevent console warnings
